GitHub URL: https://github.com/sumshy2/bonus_project.git 
Main method: MastermindDriver.java
Other classes: DrawCircle.java, ErrorCheck.java, Game. java,
InputText.java, Pegs.java

Explanation: 
	The program will ask if you would like to play Mastermind.
	If you click no or close the prompt, the program will exit
	Other wise, there will be a lengthy explanation =.=
	Then you will be asked what number of guesses and pegs you want (There are limits!)
	Clicking cancle or closing the prompt will set the guesses and pegs to default value (12 and 4 respectively)
	Then you will be asked if you want to add Maroon and/or Cyan ontop of the default colors.
	Clicking Yes will add the color(s) to our color library
	Then a prompt will appear for you to input either "history" (all lowercase) or your peg guess (must be the number of pegs you chose)
	Peg Guess format is the Capital letters of the available colors (ie. GGGG in the case there are 4 pegs means green green green green)
	The top row will display the sequence of pegs the program generated when the game is over (you either lose or win)
	If at anytime, you close the Mastermind window, the program will exit

Happy Guessing
